    - Add support for adding botspot 'friends' on the fly
        - update botspot functionality, not whisper-bot
            - main intended usage right now is whisper-bot, so it should work here
        - this should be admin-only feature
            - use botspot command filters
        - this should be persistent over restart
            - use mongo botspot component (util get_database)
            - if there's already 'friends' values in mongo - just ignore the env and load from there
                - print warning about itnnnnnnnmb
            - If not - initialize the list from env
            - Same for admins, i guess
        - Make sure our whole app keeps working if mongo component is not enabled
            - just bypass this logic part and read from env, don't crash
## Done

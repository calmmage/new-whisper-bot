# Follow-up 1

There are several significant modifications to what you did
1) look at todo.md again: i've mentioned that I want two separate implementations of ffmpeg subprocesses because i need to run memory profile to know what size server limits to run

2) in my library botspot I have a shared llm_provider. It has to be used for all llm operations. look up at botspot_101.md. it accepts username to track quotas and stuff
You have to use that for summary request

3) the duplicate detection you did wouldn't do. I implemented custom logic here, use that: text_utils.
well, modernize it to use llm_provider and cheapest new model (gpt 4.1 nano>?)
4) what the fuck is that? didn't God invent async exactly for that? I only wanted to use subprocess out of necessity in other places - because i need to use ffmpeg directly and inplace (pydub hoggles memory like crazy)
 # Run the transcription in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        result = await loop.run_in_executor(
            None,
            lambda: model.transcribe(
                str(audio_path),
                language=language,
                fp16=(device == "cuda")
            )
        )

- redo that. And.. what the fuck is this. import openai and use whisper from there (API!!!). make sure we have openai api token.

NO PYTORCH!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING??!!!

Also, make sure we have retry with backoff, because I WANT ALL JOBS TO FINISH NO MATTER WHAT. I AM CUTTING AUDIO in 50 pieces and I NEED ALL OF THEM


# Follow-up 2

1) let's actually create scripts to test all the utils separately on sample files.
We can test the following:
- convert video to audio (create a script in scripts/check_convert_video)
- cut audio (same, script in scripts/..)

By the way, did you implement audio cutting by ffmpeg in-place without excessive memory usage?
and are you running in async non-blocking subprocess?

- parse audio (i will put a working gpt token in env)
Make sure to save all results to file and add sanity checks on them (e.g. number of files after cutting, file size/format after conversion etc.)

# Follow-up 3

Remind me, how are we configuring chunk sizes?
whisper api accepts max 50 files concurrently (cut them and then launch them all right away), so for optimal peroformance that was the targeting amount of files.. Also, i don't think it takes chunks above 20 minutes or something, maybe 10.
Just in case several users submit us files simultaneously, i was thinking to avoid cutting to all 50 for smaller files.
Did you even check the logic that calculates optimal amount of chunks to cut audio in? DEFAULT_PERIOD, DEFAULT_WHISPER_RATE_LIMIT.
I don't know what is the limit on my account, but we need to play around that. Even more so - there's rate limit and there's concurrent connections limit, i think. We need to handle that properly. (assume some defaults, accept corrections from env)

1) how do we pass to the cutting util the desired parameters (and then how does it transfer that to ffmpeg? Is the assumed properties tested in our check script?)
2) where do you pass them?

Make an analysis about other files and utils if there are similar requirements that you missed. Save that analysis to a txt file, with a short summary in the end.
